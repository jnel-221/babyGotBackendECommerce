  ## Credits

  This app was created with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and is powered by [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).  A shout out to my study group and TAs who helped me get the hang of postman, and the Sequelize 'through' relationship.
